        Welcome to Mamma Khouri’s! I’m Majdolin, though most know me as Mamma
        Khouri, and alongside my husband, Wadie, or Baba Khouri, we are the
        proud owners of this heartfelt restaurant. The name ‘Khouri’ is our
        family name, and our journey to this moment is as rich and flavorful as
        the dishes we serve. Our journey begins in the beautiful lands of Syria,
        where Wadie and I were born and raised. We spent much of our lives
        between Syria and Lebanon, each place becoming a cherished home to us.
        Together, we have three beautiful daughters: Anna, Joyce, and Hilda. Our
        life took a significant turn two years after our youngest was born when
        we decided to move to Oregon, bringing with us our dreams and
        traditions. In Portland, we found not just a new home but also a
        welcoming Middle Eastern community, including some of our family
        members. It was comforting to be surrounded by familiar faces and
        traditions as we settled into this new chapter of our lives. My passion
        for cooking started when I was ten years old, under the loving guidance
        of my mother, whom my children call Teta, meaning grandma in Arabic.
        Teta taught me the basics and gradually introduced me to traditional
        dishes and her unique spins on these recipes. Cooking became a cherished
        part of my life, a form of expression, and a way to keep our heritage
        alive. At Mamma Khouri’s, every dish is a blend of generational recipes
        and my own creations. Each recipe has been carefully crafted, from
        planning to preparation to cooking and serving. I pour immense love and
        thought into every step, ensuring that every bite you take is filled
        with the authentic taste of our homeland. What I love most about cooking
        is the joy it brings to others. Seeing the smiles and satisfaction on
        people’s faces as they enjoy my food is truly rewarding. At Mamma
        Khouri’s, we promise to deliver the best, most authentic traditional
        Middle Eastern cuisine in Portland. Our commitment to freshness is key
        to maintaining the quality of our food. The meticulous hand-making
        process and our traditional cooking techniques are our secret to
        preserving the authentic flavors. One of my favorite traditions is
        sitting with Teta and my daughters, rolling grape leaves. We even use
        grape leaves picked from my aunt’s tree in her backyard, adding a
        personal touch to our dishes. Before opening Mamma Khouri’s in March of
        2021, Wadie and I had over ten years of experience in the restaurant
        industry. However, my love for cooking began at home, cooking for my
        family and friends, particularly my children and their friends. Our home
        was always filled with laughter and the delicious aroma of home-cooked
        meals. Over time, my children’s friends started calling me “Mamma
        Khouri,” and Wadie “Baba Khouri.” This loving nickname naturally became
        the name of our restaurant. I still cherish those moments when I would
        hear, “Mamma, I’m hungry!” It always brought a smile to my face and
        inspired me to share our culinary heritage with a wider community. We
        invite you to come in and experience a little taste of our home in the
        Middle East. You won’t regret it! With love, Mamma Khouri
